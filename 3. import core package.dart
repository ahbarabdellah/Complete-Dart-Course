/*

A package is a mechanism to encapsulate a group of programming
units. Applications might at times need integration of some 
third-party libraries or plugins. Every language has a mechanism 
for managing external packages like Maven or Gradle for Java, 
Nuget for .NET, npm for Node.js, etc. The package manager for Dart
is pub.

Pub helps to install packages in the repository. The repository of
packages hosted can be found at https://pub.dartlang.org/.
